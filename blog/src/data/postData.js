  content:'One of the best decisions I\'ve made in life - caused by the immense boredom of loneliness - was learning how to crochet.\nAnd, as always, if you make a good decision (for whatever reason) the universe will conspire. In my case, it introduced me to an amazing teacher, in my own office!. To her I owe understanding that crochet is easy. Like, really easy.\n\nI was convinced that crochet was an ancient art saved by the grandmother’s knowledge and that I could not access it. And I was wrong: it’s simple, very simple. I suspect that grandmothers keep this from us just for their entertainment. \n\nThe easiest thing to learn in crochet is to understand that It’s very basic. It has only five basic stitches and that’s it. Everything else are combinations of those five basic stitches. No more, I promise you.  It\'s like learning a language with only five vowels, and that\'s it. All the words are combinations and repetitions of those vowels, but there is nothing beyond those five vowels. Learning crochet is just like that.\n\nThe hardest thing to learn in crochet - especially amigurumis - is learning to think in small parts. It was a bit difficult, especially for me, because I tend to see things as a whole. And that doesn’t work in crochet. Actually, you HAVE to see every project like little pieces that later you need to sew together. Only after you put together all you pieces you can see the amigurumi. It’s a fact of crochet.\n\nIt turns out that these two basic learnings of crochet (well, I’ve learned a lot of things doing crochet, but that\'s another post) are the foundation of what you need to know to learn to program in Python. Go figure.\n\nFirst, the programs are written in steps. Step by step, like the song. And, the shorter and clearer the step (like a small part of an amigurumi), the better the program.\n\nIt’s very nice, because whenever I face a new task in Python, the ultimate goal seems unattainable. And then, I take the time to divide the project into small pieces and - at that moment -  I can see that at least the most simple (ask the user, save the answer in a variable, assign a value, create a list, create a dictionary) I already know how to do.\n\nIt’s encouraging that even when you’re a beginner you realize that you know smalls parts of the process. It’s very interesting to understand that if you face something new the best thing to do is break it down into small steps or small parts and go one step at a time. I think I would have saved a lot time worrying about many things in life if I had applied this concept to many work problems, as a project manager.\n\nSecond, programs are actually a set of words and definitions already written, and all you need to know is how to use them. Like a language. What you need to understand is the syntax and everything from there is just learning new vocabulary. That’s not difficult, that\'s just practice. There isn’t  a high difficulty in learning new words (language keywords or predefined functions) all you have to learn is how to use them correctly.\n\nAnd everything else is practice and patience, like everything in life.\n\nThe truth is that if you are of those people, like me, that needs to do something with your hands, to produce something at the end of the day, I recommend you to learn something practical, such as crochet, or code, or both.\n\nThere is no greater satisfaction - at the end of the day - than showing off something you made from scratch.\n\nAnd it’s even better if people believe that it’s very difficult (such as crochet, or code)\n\nAnd, it’s even better if you can do it from home in your pjs (such as crochet, or code)\n\nThe comparison list is long, between crochet and code. And, that’s the reason I’m telling you: crochet feels like code, and both are a pleasure\n\n'
